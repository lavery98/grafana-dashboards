# Grafana dashboards

This repository contains the dashboards that I use on my Grafana instance.
Some of these dashboards are from other places and have been modified/turned into jsonnet. Others have been generated from scratch.
[Grafonnet](https://github.com/grafana/grafonnet) is used for all dashboards that are generated by jsonnet.

They can be imported into Grafana by clicking Import and pasting the JSON into the box. For all the data to appear you will also need to use the right exporter for each dashboard and use the relevant [text collector scripts](https://github.com/lavery98/text-collectors).

## Updating dashboards
All dashboards are created from jsonnet so the JSON for each dashboard **should not be modified**. Instead the jsonnet should be modified and the JSON should be regenerated.
This can be done using the `make generate` command which will generate a new JSON files in the gen directory.
